{{% notice warning %}}
WebAssembly support is to be considered experimental.
Seeing that we have less experience with it than our server side and the fact
that the underlying Mono support for WebAssembly being used is still in test
stages, you're at your own risk.

However, that being said - we have so far had good experience with it on projects
we've used, we just need a bit more time with it.
